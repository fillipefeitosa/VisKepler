# VisKepler - A Generic Geospatial Data Visualization Dashboard

This project provides a framework for analyzing and visualizing geospatial data using KeplerGl and other data visualization libraries. Users can upload their own KeplerGl JSON configurations and GeoJSON files to create interactive dashboards.

## Libraries Used

- **KeplerGl:** Interactive geospatial visualization library.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Geopandas:** For working with geospatial data.
- **Matplotlib:** Static visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- **FastAPI:** For creating the web application to serve the dashboard.

## About

This project originated from the **GETIN** project at Universidade de Aveiro, focusing on demographic data. It has been refactored to support generic use cases, allowing users to deploy their own data and visualizations.
